First of all I want to point shamelessly to these two reprositories ,since these two i have used them without any modifiations.
Entire credit goes to these two people only 
FLIPKART API :- https://github.com/xaneem/flipkart-api-php/blob/master/clusterdev.flipkart-api.php
AMAZON API   :- https://github.com/MarcL/AmazonProductAPI/blob/master/AmazonAPI.php

you can visit these two if you have any questions 

This is just a small project I am working on .So without any shame or whatsoever I used these :)
You can find entire documentation  from above two links.
